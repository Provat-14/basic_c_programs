## üìå Program List

- **file_io.c**: Demonstrates file reading and writing in C.
- **temp_conversion.c**: Converts temperature between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
- **basic_calculator_withSwitch.c**: A simple calculator using switch-case statements.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains the main C source code files.
- **executables/**: Holds the compiled `.exe` files for quick preview.
- **docs/**: Documentation and additional resources.

Users can browse the `executables/` folder to run pre-compiled versions of the programs without needing to compile them manually.

---
## üìú Documentation
Each program has a corresponding .md file inside the docs/ folder explaining its functionality, usage, and code breakdown.


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

**Language**: C Programming

## üöÄ How to run
-  Clone the repository to your local machine.
-  Compile and run the C programs using a C compiler (like `gcc`).
   
   Example command:
   ```bash
   gcc file_io.c -o file_io
   ./file_io
- For some programs that involve file operations, ensure that the necessary files (`data.txt`, etc.) are in place.

## ‚ö° Quick Preview (Executables)
If you just want to test the programs without compiling, you can find the executable files inside the `executables/` folder.
